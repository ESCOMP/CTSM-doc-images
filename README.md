# CTSM-doc-images
Image files used in the CTSM documentation

(2020-03-27)

I don't think we'll need this any more, since I am using git lfs to store images (see https://github.com/ESCOMP/CTSM/issues/239#issuecomment-605145753). However, I'm putting it in my github space for now just in case we decide we need it.
